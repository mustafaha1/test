		4: 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
		
		You begin a 6-month long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and the site you
		have in development doesn’t work properly on the new iOS version.
		Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very different go-to-market strategy.
		Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw
		your customers away.
		A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.
