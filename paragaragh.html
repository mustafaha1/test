1: • 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?

Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the
same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution.

In fact, it’s hard to imagine any business that has not benefited from the digital revolution. Even something as hands
on as agriculture uses computers. Farmers use computers for production records, financial planning, research on
technical issues, and procurement.

Nowadays the formula for business success is simple: drive innovation with information technology. So, the first thing
startups in any industry try to figure out is how to make smart IT recruiting choices. Without a backbone of information
technology, a business is not going to go far.

Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both
tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand.
Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the
security of confidential information and trade advantages.

Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources such as time and
physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies let business owners understand how best to manage the storage costs of
holding a product. With proper technology in place, executives can save time and money by holding meetings over the
Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.

2: 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to
make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
Roles and responsibilities, define key roles and responsibilities for your team & external suppliers, ensure everyone
knows what they are expected to contribute and when, common project roles: Decision makers Project manager, Copywriter
or editor, Developer and Designer

You need management, collaboration, communication hardware software and cloud file storage systems, all this work is
getting done efficiently and with better results. These digital projects are the new faces of project management, as the
Technology is moving so fast, we must keep up with the skill which is required.


3:1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello
board.
I make sure I add all the steps that I am taking on my Trello board in order then I start putting all steps in to action
at the moment I think of using the vs editor for the website which I am going to build and use a background image for
the website and how many pages I wanted to be and how to link them with web pages inside my website and also I link them
with my Trello board at (https://trello.com/b/WEiiSKAT/web-site)


4: 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?

You begin a 6-month long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and the site you
have in development doesn’t work properly on the new iOS version.
Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very different go-to-market strategy.
Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw
your customers away.
A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.

5:1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of
technology for the job???????
Focus on Your Pain Points
Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently. The key to
choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you’re already doing well, and what you need to do
better.
Figuring out your company’s biggest pain points is the key to knowing where you can improve, and that process starts
with talking to your team. First and foremost, you want to know how they spend their time each day. A good place toA
start is to ask everyone to take a moment to estimate how much time they devote to various, but specific activities each
week. Make sure that you’re clear that you’re looking for company-wide trends, not scrutinizing individual employees’
time management.
Once you have that data, you should look for information that might surprise you. Are people spending an inordinate
amount of time just catching up on email? That might point to a need for a more efficient communication or collaboration
solution for your team. Are slow internet and Wi-Fi speeds creating bottlenecks and slowing down your day-to-day
operations? A scalable internet solution that will grow with your business may be the answer.
Other Questions to Ask Your Team
Another way to approach the problem of identifying pain points is to be a lot more explicit about what you’re looking
for. Technology is ultimately all about finding a way to maximize the ratio between output to input. It helps you get
more results for your effort.
With that in mind, try asking your team specifically about their pain points: What are the most repetitive tasks they
spend their time on? What will be the impact on this activity as we continue to grow? What is the most time-consuming
part of their job? What systems do they already know, and what have they had to learn since working here? Do they ever
find themselves waiting on something to be able to get work done?
Again, it’s important to frame this conversation the right way. You need to be clear that you’re trying to help get
things done more efficiently, and that you want to put your team in the driver’s seat. You’re not going to get the
answers you need if it seems like you might be looking into downsizing or restructuring, so be explicit about why you’re
asking these questions and how honest answers will help your employees get the solutions they need.

6: 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has
Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code version control?
Using Trello had been a great pleasure I had at my last project therefor it helped me through every steps I was taking
or preplanning my last it helped me by keeping everything in order and the section had been done it was already on the
card or the section which has espoused to be done it was still on progress card and the an even I had a card showing
what I am doing right now in general it worked really well for me



7: • 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
In May 2018 a new European privacy regulation called GDPR was enforced and permanently changed the way, as a business,
collect, store and use customer data.
Therefor from 25 May 2018, the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will affect every organisation that
processes the personal information of EU residents, Tens of thousands of organisations around the world are facing a
major upheaval in the way they process data. Complying with GDPR is not straight forward. It will require detailed
planning and collaboration with all the businesses in in the chain.
Guidance from institutions including the UK’s ICO identifies three areas GDPR will impact digital marketing: consent,
data access and data processing.
the company must be more vigilant in order to collect data from the customer and how they are using it in the future.

Unit 2, Outcome 1
1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
Copyright is essentially a private right. You, the copyright owner must decide how to exploit your copyright work and
how to enforce your copyright. A copyright owner can decide whether there will be any use of the copyright work falling
within the scope of the economic rights and, if so, whether he or she will use the copyright work and/or license one or
more other people to use the work.
Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites as it may restrict what you are publish publishing.


1.6 Describing access issues that need considering - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using
webpages and how we can overcome them
we need to consider that requirements for Web access by people with physical, visual, hearing, and cognitive or
neurological disabilities.
we have to put into account that the web we are designing or building it must have the functionality that if a blind
person trying to access it should be able to do so, such using audio control or audio description and I should mention
that having a voice control can help lots of venerable.
